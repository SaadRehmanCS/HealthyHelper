# My Personal Project - HealthyHelper

## A brief introduction

The development of this application has been inspired by a personal need that I have had for a while. 
I enjoy staying fit and feel that having a great diet is just as important as having a good workout 
routine. This app enables anyone 
interested in tracking *exactly* what food/drink 
goes into their bodies throughout the entire day to log in food information that includes 
things like amount of carbohydratess, protein, fat, etc. 
The dynamic information logging process then integrates this entry into the daily goal/limit. 

This helps users achieve peace of mind when worrying about if eating another 
cupcake in the evening might take their daily calorie intake over the limit. 
Additional features include:
-  Select specific dietary goals to work towards(cutting, bulking, etc).
- Let the app calculate BMI values to give you a better idea of your current fitness.
- Log food information for *specific* times of the day to track, plan, and meal prep more precisely.
